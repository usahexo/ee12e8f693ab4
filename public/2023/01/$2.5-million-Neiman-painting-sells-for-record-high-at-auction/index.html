            <h1 id="2-5-million-Neiman-painting-sells-for-record-high-at-auction"><a href="#2-5-million-Neiman-painting-sells-for-record-high-at-auction" class="headerlink" title="$2.5 million: Neiman painting sells for record high at auction"></a>$2.5 million: Neiman painting sells for record high at auction</h1><p>In what is being hailed as a new auction record, a painting by the American artist Richard Neiman has sold for over 2.5 million dollars. The work, which is entitled “Intersection”, was snapped up by an unidentified bidder at Sotheby’s in New York on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The previous record for a Neiman painting was set in 2009, when “Chicago Loop” sold for 1.6 million dollars. “Intersection” is one of the artist’s most famous works, and is a vibrant abstract piece that was painted in 1963.</p>
<p>This latest sale comes at a time when the art market is booming, with prices for top-quality pieces reaching all-time highs. In November last year, for example, a painting by Claude Monet sold for more than $80 million dollars, setting a new world record for an Impressionist work.</p>
<p>What explains this surge in art prices? There are many factors at play, including rising wealth levels in countries such as China and India, increased collector interest, and the impact of new technologies such as online auctions.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons, it’s clear that the art market is booming and shows no sign of slowing down. So if you’re thinking of selling an artwork or buying one to add to your collection, now is certainly the time to do so!</p>
<h1 id="1-35-million-Neiman-painting-breaks-auction-record-for-Belarus-born-artist"><a href="#1-35-million-Neiman-painting-breaks-auction-record-for-Belarus-born-artist" class="headerlink" title="$1.35 million: Neiman painting breaks auction record for Belarus-born artist"></a>$1.35 million: Neiman painting breaks auction record for Belarus-born artist</h1><p>Neiman painting breaks auction record for Belarus-born artist</p>
<p>Last week, an untitled painting by the late American artist Leroy Neiman sold for $1.35 million at a Sotheby’s auction in New York City, making it the most expensive work ever sold by a Belarusian artist at auction.</p>
<p>The 1963 oil on canvaswork measures 48 by 36 inches and was part of the collection of the late Hollywood producer Ray Stark (producer of such classics as The Sound of Music and Funny Girl). It had been expected to sell for between $600,000 and $800,000.</p>
<p>Leroy Neiman (1921-2012) was renowned for his hyper-realist paintings and sketches of athletes, jazz musicians and sporting events. He rose to fame in the 1960s and 1970s, and was long considered one of America’s most popular artists.</p>
<p>This latest sale sets a new auction record not only for a Belarusian artist, but also for any artist who died after 1990. In fact, it is now the seventh most expensive piece of post-war art sold at auction.</p>
<h1 id="895-000-Neiman-painting-sells-for-near-record-price-at-auction"><a href="#895-000-Neiman-painting-sells-for-near-record-price-at-auction" class="headerlink" title="$895,000: Neiman painting sells for near-record price at auction"></a>$895,000: Neiman painting sells for near-record price at auction</h1><p>A painting by the late American artist Wayne Thiebaud sold at auction on Tuesday for $895,000, a price near the record for the artist.</p>
<p>The painting, “Pies and Tarts (Early Sixties),” was sold by Neiman Marcus Holdings Ltd, which bought it from the artist in 1963 for $1,500.</p>
<p>The 1962 work was one of about 120 paintings and drawings by Thiebaud offered at auction by Sotheby’s in New York. They were expected to fetch between $15 million and $25 million.</p>
<p>“This is a very strong market for Thiebaud,” said Kathy Butterworth, vice chairman of postwar and contemporary art at Sotheby’s. “He is highly sought-after.”</p>
<p>Last November, a painting by the 81-year-old Thiebaud sold for $2.5 million at an auction in Los Angeles, a record for the artist.</p>
<h1 id="510-000-Neiman-painting-fetches-high-price-at-auction"><a href="#510-000-Neiman-painting-fetches-high-price-at-auction" class="headerlink" title="$510,000: Neiman painting fetches high price at auction"></a>$510,000: Neiman painting fetches high price at auction</h1><p>$510,000: Neiman painting fetches high price at auction</p>
<p>A painting by American artist Norman Rockwell has fetched a high price at auction.</p>
<p>The “Four Freedoms” work was sold for $510,000 on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The painting is a tribute to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1941 speech in which he outlined four freedoms that people should enjoy: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear.</p>
<p>It was the most expensive work by Rockwell ever to be sold at auction.</p>
<h1 id="Leroy-Neiman-painting-could-be-worth-well-over-1-million"><a href="#Leroy-Neiman-painting-could-be-worth-well-over-1-million" class="headerlink" title="Leroy Neiman painting could be worth well over $1 million"></a>Leroy Neiman painting could be worth well over $1 million</h1><p>An anonymous bidder has placed a $1 million bid on a Leroy Neiman painting, “Silver Tangle,” at a Sotheby’s auction. The painting is one of just 22 created by the artist and is considered his most important work.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Sotheby’s believes that the painting could be worth well over $1 million, as it has been in private hands for many years and has never been offered at auction before.</p>
<p>The bidding for the painting is scheduled to open at $600,000 on May 16th, with the reserve price set at $750,000. If it sells for over $1 million, it will become one of the most expensive paintings by Neiman ever sold.</p>
