Garden decor is any type of ornamentation that is used to enhance the appearance of a garden. Lawn ornaments are decorations that are placed in the yard, but not in the garden. They can be anything from statues and bird baths to windmills and topiaries.</p>
<p>The first known instances of garden decor and lawn ornaments date back to ancient Greece and Rome. Both cultures were known for their love of gardening, and they would use all sorts of decorative items to dress up their gardens. Statues, arbors, and fountains were all popular choices.

<p>During the Middle Ages, people began using plants to decorate their yards. Topiaries became popular during this time, as did herb gardens. Gardens became more elaborate during the Renaissance, with homeowners adding statues, ponds, and other features.</p>
<p>In the 1800s, Americans began using lawn ornaments to define their property lines. Items like cast iron animals and topiary balls became popular choices. The early 1900s saw a surge in popularity for windmills, which were used to power various devices like pumps and generators.</p>

There are so many different types and styles of garden decor available that it can be difficult to decide which one is right for your space. Here are a few tips to help you choose the perfect garden ornament or decor for your home:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consider your personal style and taste.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step in choosing garden decor is to consider your personal style and taste. If you prefer a more modern look, you may want to opt for sleek, minimalist pieces, while those with a more traditional style may prefer something more ornate or traditional. Take into account the overall feel of your home and garden when making your decision.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Think about the function of the piece.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another thing to consider when choosing garden decor is its function. If you’re looking for something to cover up an unsightly area or add some privacy, choose a piece that will serve that purpose. If you’re looking for something purely decorative, think about what type of effect you want it to have in your garden. For example, if you have a lot of flowers and plants, you may want to choose something that will blend in with the surroundings rather than stand out.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Choose a material that will withstand the elements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important consideration when choosing garden decor is the material from which it is made. Some materials, such as metal or plastic, are better suited for outdoor use than others because they are more weatherproof. If you live in a particularly windy or rainy area, make sure to choose a piece that can withstand those conditions.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Consider size and scale.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, when choosing garden decor, be sure to consider size and scale. You don’t want something that is too small or large for your space – it should be in proportion with the rest of your home and garden. Also, think about how much sun or shade the piece will get – if it doesn’t get much sun, it won’t need to be as weatherproof as something that will be exposed to direct sunlight all day long.</p>
