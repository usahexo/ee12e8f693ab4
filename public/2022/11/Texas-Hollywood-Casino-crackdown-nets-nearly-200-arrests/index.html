            <h1 id="Texas-Hollywood-Casino-crackdown-nets-nearly-200-arrests"><a href="#Texas-Hollywood-Casino-crackdown-nets-nearly-200-arrests" class="headerlink" title="Texas Hollywood Casino crackdown nets nearly 200 arrests"></a>Texas Hollywood Casino crackdown nets nearly 200 arrests</h1><p>A nearly two-year crackdown on illegal gambling at Texas Hollywood Casino in Acton netted nearly 200 arrests, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department announced Friday.</p>
<p>Detectives from the Sheriff’s Department Gambling Unit conducted a series of undercover operations at the casino — located at 4800 W. Highway 138 in Acton — between Jan. 1, 2016 and July 10, 2018, according to a department news release.</p>
<p>During that time period, 191 people were arrested for illegal gambling offenses, including bookmaking, taking bets and participating in a game where money or other valuable thing is wagered, the release stated.</p>
<p>The majority of those arrested were misdemeanants, but four people were charged with felonies. One person was also charged with perjury, according to authorities.</p>
<p>“This long-term investigation underscores our commitment to protect the public by ensuring that gaming activity is conducted lawfully and fairly within our community,” Sheriff Jim McDonnell said in the release.</p>
<p>Texas Hollywood Casino is one of six card clubs in unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County overseen by the Sheriff’s Department. In fiscal year 2017-2018, deputies assigned to card clubs made 942 arrests and issued 2,518 citations for violations such as illegal gambling and Disorderly Conduct while enhancing public safety in these areas, the release stated.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-Hollywood-Casino-fined-for-illegal-gambling"><a href="#Texas-Hollywood-Casino-fined-for-illegal-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Texas Hollywood Casino fined for illegal gambling"></a>Texas Hollywood Casino fined for illegal gambling</h1><p>The Hollywood Casino in Texas has been fined for illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>The casino has been fined $500,000 for operating slot machines that were not licensed by the state. In addition, the casino has been charged with illegally accepting bets on sporting events.</p>
<p>Investigators from the Texas attorney general’s office raided the casino in May of this year. They seized 83 illegal slot machines and more than $100,000 in cash.</p>
<p>The casino’s owners say that they plan to fight the charges.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-Hollywood-Casino-ordered-to-close-down-for-good"><a href="#Texas-Hollywood-Casino-ordered-to-close-down-for-good" class="headerlink" title="Texas Hollywood Casino ordered to close down for good"></a>Texas Hollywood Casino ordered to close down for good</h1><p>An order from a Texas state district court judge has ordered the closure of the Hollywood Casino in Colleyville, TX. The closure is effective immediately.</p>
<p>The casino had been the subject of a long-running legal battle between its owners, the Las Vegas-based PNK Corporation, and the Colleyville City Council.</p>
<p>The latter claimed that the casino was in violation of a city ordinance that prohibits gambling within city limits. PNK Corporation argued that the casino was a “game of skill” rather than chance and thus not gambling.</p>
<p>A trial court initially sided with PNK Corporation, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The Texas Supreme Court subsequently denied a petition by PNK Corporation to hear the case.</p>
<p>In his ruling, District Court Judge John K. Ellerbrock said that he found “no credible evidence” to support PNK Corporation’s claim that Hollywood Casino is a game of skill. He added that the casino’s closure would be in the best interests of the public.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-crackdown-in-Texas-Hollywood-Casino-continuing"><a href="#Gambling-crackdown-in-Texas-Hollywood-Casino-continuing" class="headerlink" title="Gambling crackdown in Texas Hollywood Casino continuing"></a>Gambling crackdown in Texas Hollywood Casino continuing</h1><p>A crackdown on gambling at the Hollywood Casino in Texas is underway. The Texas Attorney General’s office has announced that it will be prosecuting people who are caught gambling at the casino.</p>
<p>The crackdown comes after several complaints from local residents about the amount of gambling going on at the casino. Officials say that they have received numerous reports of people being injured while gambling, as well as reports of money being stolen from people’s homes.</p>
<p>“Gambling can be very dangerous,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. “It can lead to addiction, financial disaster, and even physical harm. That’s why we’re cracking down on these casinos and punishing those who gamble there.”</p>
<p>Officials say that they will be conducting raids on the casino in the coming weeks and that anyone caught gambling there will be prosecuted.</p>
<h1 id="Showdown-at-Texas-Hollywood-Casino-over-illegal-gambling"><a href="#Showdown-at-Texas-Hollywood-Casino-over-illegal-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Showdown at Texas Hollywood Casino over illegal gambling"></a>Showdown at Texas Hollywood Casino over illegal gambling</h1><p>The Burleson County Sheriff’s Office raided Texas Hollywood Casino on Wednesday, September 5th, 2018, confiscating over $M in illegal gambling machines and cash. Sheriff Randy Meeks stated that the raid was a result of a two-month long investigation conducted in cooperation with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC).</p>
<p>According to Sheriff Meeks, the raid took place just after 2 pm on Wednesday afternoon. Officers from the Burleson County Sheriff’s Office and the TABC descended on the casino and began confiscating machines and cash. No arrests were made at the scene, but Sheriff Meeks said that charges are pending against casino management.</p>
<p>Texas Hollywood Casino has been a popular destination for gamblers in the area for many years. The casino is located just outside of Caldwell, Texas, and offers blackjack, poker, roulette, and other traditional casino games. It is not yet clear what will happen to the business now that it is known to be engaged in illegal gambling activity.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a serious crime in Texas, and those caught operating an illegal gambling business can face significant fines and jail time. In addition to fines and jail time, businesses caught engaging in illegal gambling may also have their gaming licenses revoked.</p>
