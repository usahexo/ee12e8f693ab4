Who created it and who maintains it? No one knows for sure, but there are a few theories.</p>
<p>One possibility is that an unknown third party created the software. This could be anyone from a disgruntled former employee of Jagex to an independent programmer who decided to enter the online gaming market. Whoever it is, they’ve managed to stay hidden behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Another theory is that Jagex themselves developed the software. After all, they have the experience and resources needed to create something like this. They also have a vested interest in ensuring the success of their new gambling venture. However, this seems less likely than the first possibility, as Jagex would undoubtedly want to take credit for their achievement.</p>
<p>Whoever created the software, they’ve done an impressive job. It’s been running smoothly since the casino opened its doors and shows no signs of slowdown. This bodes well for both Jagex and players alike – everyone stands to benefit from a thriving Osrs gambling scene.</p>
