In a statement, the amphitheatre said that it made the decision to close in order to "help prevent the spread of COVID-19." The closure will affect all events scheduled at the venue through the end of April.

This is just the latest venue to close due to COVID-19. Earlier this month, major venues such as Madison Square Garden in New York City and The Forum in Inglewood, California both announced closures.

#  Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Lenz To Reopen In June

Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre in Lenz, IL will reopen in June after being closed since September of 2018. The closure was due to damage from severe flooding that occurred in the area.

The $54 million renovation of the amphitheater is now complete and includes a new entrance, expanded seating, new food and beverage options, and a larger lawn area.

Tickets for most shows at the amphitheater will go on sale starting this Friday, with a limited number of pre-sale tickets available starting today.

#  Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Lenz Sold to New Owner

The Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Lenz was recently sold to a new owner. The venue, which is located in Tinley Park, Illinois, has been a popular spot for concerts and other events since it opened in 1990.

The new ownership group, which is made up of investors from Michigan and Illinois, plans to make some changes to the venue. They hope to make the Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Lenz one of the top music venues in the Midwest. Some of the changes that are being planned include adding a new stage and expanding the seating capacity.

The owners also plan to improve the food and beverage options at the venue. This will include adding more food trucks and increasing the number of concession stands. They also plan to add new bars, including a rooftop bar overlooking the stage.

The Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Lenz is currently owned by Live Nation. Live Nation is a large concert promoter that owns or operates more than 120 venues around the world. The company has not yet commented on the sale of the Tinley Park venue.

The Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Lenz is not the only Live Nation-owned venue that has been sold recently. In December 2017, Live Nation sold its stake in Toronto's Budweiser Stage to two different companies. One of those companies is Toronto-based landlord Cadillac Fairview Corporation, while the other is an investment firm from Florida called Ascent Hospitality Management LLC.

#  Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Lenz Renamed The Venue

The Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Lenz has been renamed after the casino company purchased the naming rights for the next twenty years. The $20 million deal was Chicago-based Penn National’s largest sponsorship agreement to date.
