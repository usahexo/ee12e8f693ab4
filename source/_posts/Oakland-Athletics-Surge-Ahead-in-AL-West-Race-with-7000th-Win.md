#  Oakland Athletics Surge Ahead in AL West Race with 7000th Win

The Oakland Athletics have surged ahead in the AL West race, notching their 7000th win on Wednesday night.

Led by a resurgent offense and an all-star caliber season from pitcher Mike Fiers, the A’s have now won 9 of their last 10 games and sit just 2.5 games back of the Houston Astros for first place in the division.

Fiers has been a bright spot for the A’s all season long, racking up 16 wins while posting a solid 3.90 ERA. But it hasn’t been just Fiers leading the way for Oakland – the team’s offense has been swinging hot bats lately, scoring 5 or more runs in 7 of their last 10 games.

Of course, it’s still very early in the season and there’s plenty of baseball left to be played. But with the Athletics clicking on all cylinders right now, it looks like they could be a force to be reckoned with down the stretch.

#  Seattle Mariners Fall Behind in AL West Race with 7000th Loss

After a 7-1 loss to the Houston Astros on Wednesday night, the Seattle Mariners have now fallen behind in the AL West race with their 7000th loss.

The Mariners (59-70) are now 18 games back of first-place Houston in the division, and they will likely miss out on the postseason for the 17th consecutive year.

This season has been especially frustrating for Mariners fans, as Seattle has had plenty of opportunities to win but has come up short time and time again.

One of the biggest issues for Seattle this season has been its starting pitching. The team's starters have an ERA of 4.92, which is the worst in all of baseball.

Another issue has been their lack of power at the plate. The Mariners currently rank 27th in home runs and last in slugging percentage.

Their offense has been led by Dee Gordon, who is batting .294 with 19 stolen bases. But no other player on the team is hitting above .270.

The Mariners will look to get back on track when they face off against the Astros again on Thursday night.

#  Los Angeles Angels Close Gap on Oakland Athletics After 7000th Victory

The Angels made a statement on Monday night, coming back from four runs behind to beat the Oakland Athletics 7-5. This was the 7000th victory in franchise history for the Angels, and it keeps them firmly in the hunt for a playoff berth.

This latest win was especially important because it pulled the Angels within two games of the Athletics in the AL West. The Athletics have been one of the top teams in baseball this season, but the Angels are starting to close the gap.

Mike Trout led the way for the Angels on Monday night, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs. He has been one of the best players in baseball this season, and he is certainly doing his part to help the Angels make a playoff run.

Besides Trout, J.B. Shuck also had a big night for the Angels, going 3 for 4 with two RBIs. It was another indication that this team is capable of beating anyone when they are playing at their best.

The Angels will need to keep playing well if they want to catch up to the Athletics. But with Mike Trout leading the way, there is no telling what they might be able to accomplish in the second half of the season.

#  Texas Rangers Stay in Hunt for AL West Crown Despite 7000th Defeat

The Texas Rangers have been one of the most consistent teams in baseball this season. They sit atop the American League West Division with a record of 73-59, just two games ahead of the second place Seattle Mariners. Despite their 7000th defeat on Thursday night, the Rangers are still in good shape to make a playoff run.

One big reason for their success this season has been their starting pitching staff. Ace pitcher Cole Hamels has been as good as ever, posting a 3.30 ERA and striking out 161 batters in 165 innings pitched. Fellow starters Andrew Cashner, Tyson Ross, and Martin Perez have also played well, putting up a combined 3.62 ERA.

The Rangers offense has also been solid this year, led by All-Star outfielder Nomar Mazara. Mazara is hitting .290 with 27 homers and 85 RBIs this season. Other contributors at the plate include Shin-Soo Choo, Rougned Odor, and Elvis Andrus.

If the Rangers can continue to play well down the stretch and secure one of the top two spots in the AL West, they will be in good position to make a deep run in the playoffs.

#  Houston Astros Remain in the cellar of the AL West Division with 7000th Loss

Houston, TX - The Houston Astros have not fared well in the past few years and their performance in the 2017 season is no different. With a current standing of 32-70, they are at the bottom of the AL West Division. This week, they added their 7000th loss overall to their record.

This dismal season can be partially attributed to their lack of offensive production. Currently, they rank last in the league in batting average (.235) and runs scored (423). Their pitching staff hasn’t been much better, ranking 27th in ERA (4.93) and WHIP (1.44).

Some of the Astros players have shown flashes of hope this year. Second baseman Jose Altuve is currently leading the league in batting average (.349) and has hit 19 home runs so far. Outfielder George Springer is close behind him with a batting average of .342 and 22 home runs on the season. However, other players on the team have not fared as well. Third baseman Alex Bregman has a batting average of .247 and first baseman Yuli Gurriel has a batting average of .283.

The Astros will need to make some changes if they want to turn their season around. They will likely be looking to trade some of their players prior to the trade deadline at the end of July. Some potential trades that have been speculated are for pitcher Gerrit Cole or second baseman Josh Reddick. The Astros may also look to add some new talent through the draft or through free agency this offseason.

Regardless of what changes they make, it is likely that the Astros will continue to struggle in future seasons. With such a young team, they will need more time to develop and improve their skills. In the meantime, fans can look forward to watching other teams compete in the playoffs this year.
