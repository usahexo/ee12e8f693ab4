#  You Could Get a Bonus XP Reward for Playing Games on PS4 

Gaming on your PlayStation 4 can give you a little extra something in the form of XP bonuses. While it’s not a major incentive, it can still give you that little boost you need to get ahead.

In order to claim your bonus XP, all you have to do is link your account to PlayStation Network and start playing. The bonus will be automatically awarded to you as soon as you start playing. You don’t even need to complete the game in order to get the bonus; just playing through it will do.

There are a few different games that offer this bonus XP reward, and they are: 

“Assassin’s Creed Origins,” “Call of Duty: WWII,” “Destiny 2,” “Fallout 4,” “FIFA 18,” “Horizon Zero Dawn,” “Injustice 2,” “Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite,” “Middle-earth: Shadow of War,” “NBA 2K18,” and “The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition.” 

So if you have any of these games and have yet to play them, now might be the time to do so. Who knows? You might just end up getting a nice reward for your efforts.

#  How Many Times Can You Get Bonus XP in a Day? 

In "Destiny 2", players are able to earn experience points (XP) by completing activities such as Public Events, Adventures, and Strikes. As players progress through the game, they will eventually reach a level cap of 20. After reaching the level cap, players can continue to earn XP to unlock new Power levels for their character.

One way to earn XP quickly is by using a XP bonus multiplier called a "Power Surge". A Power Surge multiplies the amount of XP earned from any activity by x2, x3, or x5. The multiplier lasts for 30 minutes and can be used multiple times per day.

Here is a list of how many times you can use a Power Surge in a day, based on your Power level: 

Power Level 1-9: 2 times
Power Level 10-19: 3 times
Power Level 20-29: 4 times
Power Level 30-39: 5 times
Power Level 40-49: 6 times
Power Level 50-59: 7 times
Power Level 60-69: 8 times
Power Level 70-79: 9 times
Power Level 80+: 10 times

#  Make the Most Out of Your Rewards with These Helpful Tips

Are you someone who loves to collect rewards cards? If so, you're probably always looking for ways to make the most out of them. Luckily, there are a few helpful tips that can help you do just that.

#1. Use Your Rewards Cards for Everyday Purchases

One of the best ways to make the most out of your rewards cards is to use them for everyday purchases. This way, you can rack up points or miles quickly. Additionally, you'll be able to avoid paying interest on those purchases.

#2. Be Strategic with Your Credit Card Usage

If you have multiple rewards cards, be strategic about which one you use for specific purchases. For example, if you're buying a $100 item, it might make sense to use a card that offers 2x miles per dollar spent. That way, you'll earn 200 miles on that purchase.

#3. Combine Your Rewards with Those of Your Spouse or Partner

If you have a spouse or partner, consider combining your rewards with theirs. This can help you rack up points or miles even faster. Additionally, it can help you qualify for larger rewards bonuses.

#4. Look for Rewards That Fit Your Lifestyle

Not all rewards are created equal. Make sure to look for ones that fit your lifestyle and spending habits. For example, if you rarely fly but often take Uber or Lyft rides, it might make sense to sign up for a card that offers bonus points for travel-related expenses rather than one that offers bonus points for restaurant spending.

#5. Don't Forget About Your Loyalty Programs!

In addition to using rewards cards, don't forget about your loyalty programs! Many airlines and hotel chains offer loyalty programs that offer great benefits, such as free flights and hotel stays. Make sure to rack up points and miles in those programs as well!
