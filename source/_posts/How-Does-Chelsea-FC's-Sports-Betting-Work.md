On November 6th, Chelsea will be travelling to Azerbaijan to take on Qarabag FK in their fourth group stage match of the UEFA Champions League. As of now, Chelsea are considered heavy favourites to win with odds of 1/7 at most major bookmakers. Qarabag are listed at 14/1 to win while a draw is priced at 10/1.

There are a few things worth considering when betting on this match. First of all, Chelsea have already secured qualification for the next round so they may not be as motivated to win this match as Qarabag who still have everything to play for. Secondly, Qarabag have been surprisingly strong in defence throughout the tournament so far and have only conceded two goals in three matches. This could mean that they may be able to keep Chelsea from scoring which would lead to a payout at higher odds than usual.

Another option when betting on this match is predicting which team will score first. As mentioned earlier, Qarabag have been strong defensively but they also lack firepower up front so it's unlikely that they will be the first team to score. On the other hand, Chelsea have several dangerous attacking players and are likely to score early on if they can find space behind Qarabag's defence. Odds for either team to score first range from 2/5 to Even money (1/1), making it a decent option for those looking for a bit more value.

In conclusion, while Chelsea are heavy favourites to win their upcoming match against Qarabag FK they are not without risk. There are several potential outcomes that could result in a payout and choosing the right one can be profitable for those know what they're doing.
