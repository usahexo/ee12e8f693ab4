#  Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey Bring Online Gambling to the States

Gambling has been around in one form or another for centuries. And while some forms of gambling are still illegal in the United States, many states are now legalizing different types of gambling.

In 2013, Delaware became the first state to legalize online gambling. They were soon followed by Nevada and New Jersey. Each of these states have their own regulations regarding online gambling.

Delaware allows residents 18 years and older to gamble online. They can play casino games, bet on sports, and play poker. The state gets a percentage of the money wagered, which is used to fund education and other programs.

Nevada also allows residents 18 years and older to gamble online. However, they only allow residents to gamble on casino games and poker. In order to gamble online in Nevada, you must be physically located in the state.

New Jersey allows residents 21 years and older to gamble online. You can play casino games, bet on sports, and play poker. The state gets a percentage of the money wagered, which is used to fund education and other programs. New Jersey was the first state to offer legal sports betting.

#  Pennsylvania Joins the Three States in Offering Legal Online Gambling

The Pennsylvania online gambling scene is heating up, with three separate licenses having been awarded to propose online casino and poker platforms. Mohegan Sun Pocono, Live! Casino & Hotel, and Parx Casino have all been granted licenses to offer real-money gaming to players within the state’s borders.

In addition to the casinos, the Mount Airy Resort & Casino was also given a license to offer slots and table games over the internet. However, they will not be offering poker at this time.

This brings the total number of states that offer some form of legal online gambling to three, joining New Jersey and Nevada. Delaware was the first state to legalize online gambling in 2012.

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) voted unanimously on Wednesday to award these licenses. The move is seen as a way for the casinos to stay competitive in an era when many people are choosing to gamble online instead of making the trip to a brick-and-mortar casino.

“I think it’s important that we offer our customers something that they can only find here in Pennsylvania, and that’s online gaming,” said Bruce Seidman, CEO of Mohegan Sun Pocono.

Prior to this decision, only blackjack and live dealer games were available to Pennsylvanians over the internet. The new licenses will allow for a much wider variety of games, including slots, roulette, and craps. Players will also be able to bet on sports events using their computers or mobile devices.

One important thing to note is that these licenses are only valid for casinos located in Pennsylvania. So if you happen to be living in another state and you want to gamble online through one of these platforms, you won’t be able to.

#  Connecticut Moving Forward with Plans for Online Gambling

_After years of debate and speculation, the state of Connecticut is moving forward with plans to offer online gambling. The move is seen as a way to bolster the state's coffers, as well as to provide a new form of entertainment for residents._

The state's legislature has passed a bill that would allow for both online poker and casino games. The measure still needs to be signed into law by Governor Dannel Malloy, but this is seen as a formality. Once the law is in place, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation will begin accepting applications from operators who want to offer online gambling in the state.

The move comes after several years of discussion about whether or not to offer online gambling in Connecticut. There were concerns about the impact that this would have on the state's casinos, which are already facing competition from casinos in other states. However, lawmakers eventually decided that it was worth giving it a try, especially given the potential for additional revenue.

It's not yet clear how much money the state can expect to make from online gambling. However, it's estimated that this could be in the range of $80 million per year. This would be a significant boost to the state's budget, which has been struggling in recent years.

In addition to providing extra revenue, lawmakers also hope that online gambling will provide a new form of entertainment for residents. This could help keep people in Connecticut rather than spending their money at casinos outside of the state.

There are still some details that need to be worked out before online gambling goes live in Connecticut. For example, it's not clear yet what age limit will be in place for players. However, lawmakers are confident that everything will be ready by later this year, when the first licenses are expected to be issued.

#  More States Considering Legislation for Legal Online Gambling

In the first quarter of 2019, there were at least five states that introduced or reintroduced legislation related to online gambling. Those states include Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, New York, and Pennsylvania.

Indiana was the first to take action by reintroducing a bill that would legalize online sports betting in February. The bill did not make it through the state legislature during the last session but sponsor Sen. Jon Ford is confident this will be the year it passes.

Iowa also took action in February by introducing a bill that would legalize all forms of online gambling, including poker and casino games. This is a departure from the state’s current law that only allows for intermittent betting on horse races.

Louisiana followed suit in March by re-introducing a bill that would expand its existing legal landscape for charitable gaming to include internet bingo, raffles, and poker tournaments. The bill also allows for licensed casinos to offer real-money wagering on casino games over the internet.

In April, two more states got on board with online gambling legislation when New York introduced a bill that would legalize and regulate online poker while Pennsylvania reintroduced a bill that would legalize online casino games and sports betting.

What do these states have in common? They all see potential tax revenue from legalizing and regulating online gambling. In New York, for example, the state forecasts up to $369 million in new annual tax revenue from regulated online poker alone.

This isn’t surprising given that the global market for legal online gambling is projected to grow from $41 billion in 2018 to $81 billion by 2022 according to research firm H2 Gambling Capital. With more and more states looking to tap into this growing market, it’s likely we will see even more action on this issue in the months to come.

#  California Weighing In on the legality of online gambling

The future of online gambling is at a crossroads in the state of California. Lawmakers are currently considering two very different bills on the subject, one that would legalize and regulate the activity, and one that would outlaw it altogether.

This debate is taking place against the backdrop of a number of states that have already legalized some form of online gambling. Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have all enacted laws that allow some type of casino gaming to be played online.

The legalization of online gambling has been a contentious issue for many years. Supporters argue that it is a safe and convenient way for people to gamble, and that it can generate significant revenue for states. Opponents contend that it can lead to increased problem gambling, and that it is too easy for minors to access these websites.

So far, the momentum seems to be with those in favor of legalizing online gambling. In addition to the states mentioned above, several others are considering similar legislation, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, and Rhode Island.

The proposed California bill S 2015 would establish a regulatory framework for online poker, blackjack, and other casino games. The Department of Justice would be responsible for licensing and regulating operators, while the California Gambling Control Commission would oversee player safety and security. The bill would also impose a 15% tax on gross gaming revenue.

SB 9 is a competing bill that would make all forms of online gambling illegal in California. It was introduced by State Senator Isadore Hall III in response to his concerns about the negative impacts of online gaming.

So far there has been no public polling on this issue in California, but nationwide support for legalizing online gambling is growing. A poll conducted by Monmouth University in February found that 59% of Americans supported legalizing online poker specifically. This was up from 50% who said the same thing in a similar poll taken in 2013.
