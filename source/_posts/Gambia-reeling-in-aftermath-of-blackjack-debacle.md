#  Gambia reeling in aftermath of blackjack debacle

### The Gambia is still reeling from the aftermath of the blackjack debacle, which saw the president, Yahya Jammeh, lose millions of dollars in a single night.

The incident took place at a high-stakes game of blackjack at the Casino de Bruxelles, in which Jammeh lost around $11 million. He has since been accused of cheating, with some reports alleging that he was using a secret computer to help him win.

The affair has caused significant embarrassment for Jammeh, and led to protests and calls for his resignation. It has also raised questions about his fitness to rule Gambia, a country that is already struggling with poverty and political instability.

Jammeh has denied any wrong-doing, insisting that he simply had a bad night at the casino. However, many people are not convinced by his story, and believe that he was caught cheating.

The blackjack debacle is just the latest in a long line of scandals involving Jammeh. He has been accused of human rights abuses, corruption and electoral fraud, among other things. His rule has been characterised by repression and lack of democracy.

The events of the past few weeks have shone a light on these issues, and could lead to real change in Gambia. The country needs a leader who is accountable to the people and respects their rights. Jammeh does not fit that description, and it is time for him to go.

#  President Barrow urges calm after blackjack upset

The Gambian president, Adama Barrow, has called for calm after blackjack upset in the capital, Banjul.

Barrow took office in January 2017 after a disputed election that saw Yahya Jammeh ousted.

Since then, the country has enjoyed relative peace and stability.

However, on Monday violence erupted in Banjul after a group of youths protesting against poor living conditions began playing blackjack. Security forces responded with tear gas and live ammunition, killing at least three people.

In a televised address on Tuesday, Barrow urged Gambians to "remain calm and law-abiding". He also promised to investigate the killings and bring those responsible to justice.

"I want to assure you that this government is committed to the protection of your rights," he said. "We will not tolerate any form of violence."

The protests were reportedly sparked by the death of a young boy who was hit by a police car. The Gambian authorities have denied responsibility, saying he was killed by protesters.

#  Analysts weigh in on Gambia's stunning blackjack loss

In April, The Gambia's state-owned gaming company, the Gambian Gaming Corporation (GGC), lost a staggering $9.3 million in a single blackjack game at the Swiss Casino in Geneva. Gambian officials have been tight-lipped about the debacle, but analysts say the loss is likely a result of rampant corruption and mismanagement in the GGC.

"The Gambian government has been plundering the GGC for years, and it's finally caught up with them," said Sidi Sanneh, a Gambian analyst and former ambassador to the United States. "They've been looting the company's profits to finance their lavish lifestyle while leaving it deeply in debt."

Sanneh said that GGC has long been used as a slush fund by Gambian politicians and their cronies, who have syphoned off millions of dollars from the company. "It's been an open secret that the GGC is rife with corruption," he said. "But no one really cared because it was owned by the government."

The loss is a major blow to The Gambia's economy, which is already struggling with high unemployment and a fragile banking sector. It also underscores the need for urgent reform at the GGC, which has been plagued by corruption and mismanagement for years.

"This is a wake-up call for The Gambia," said Amadou Scatwold Janneh, an economist at Gamtel, The Gambia's state-owned telecommunications company. "We need to get our act together and reform our gaming sector if we want to attract foreign investors."

#  Opposition leaders call for Barrow's resignation after blackjack failure

Opposition leaders are calling for Gambian President Adama Barrow to step down after his government's blackjack game with Saudi Arabia went wrong.

After months of negotiation, Gambia agreed to a $ Saudi Arabia agreed to invest in its development. However, the two sides could not agree on the details of the blackjack game, resulting in a stalemate.

The opposition argues that Barrow has failed to deliver on his promises and should resign. "He is not fit to lead this country," said one opposition leader.

President Barrow has defended his record, stating that he has made progress in improving the economy and restoring democracy. He also points out that Saudi Arabia has not cancelled its investment.

The standoff between the president and the opposition looks set to continue.

#  Gambia searches for scapegoats after monumental blackjack loss

The small West African country of Gambia is in a panic after losing millions of dollars in a single blackjack game. The government is scrambling to find scapegoats, and has arrested several casino employees.

Officials are pointing fingers at everyone from the casino managers to the dealers to the players themselves. But most observers believe that the blame lies with Gambian president Yahya Jammeh himself.

Jammeh is known for his erratic behavior and grandiose statements. He has claimed that he can cure AIDS and Ebola, and that he can control the weather. In this case, it seems that he may have been overconfident in his own gaming skills.

Whatever the case may be, Gambia is facing a serious financial crisis. The government is desperate to find someone to blame, and it's unclear how the country will recover from this debacle.
