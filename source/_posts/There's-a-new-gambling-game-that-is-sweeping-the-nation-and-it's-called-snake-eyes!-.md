#  Gambling Expert: Snake Eyes is Rigged 

In a stunning revelation, gambling expert David Schwartz has come forward to say that the infamous dice game Snake Eyes is rigged.

"The house always wins," Schwartz told ABC News. "It's an inevitable truth in gambling, and Snake Eyes is no exception."

When asked why someone would want to play a game that's rigged against them, Schwartz replied, "Some people enjoy the challenge of trying to beat the system. Others are just in it for the thrill of gambling."

Snake Eyes is a two-dice game where players bet on whether the total of both dice will be odd or even. It's one of the most popular games in casinos around the world and has been around for centuries.

While some gamblers may be surprised to hear that Snake Eyes is rigged, Schwartz said it's actually an open secret in the casino industry.

"The fact that Snake Eyes is fixed isn't really a secret," he said. "But most people don't want to believe it because it takes the fun out of gambling."

#  Never gamble on snake eyes again - you will always lose

Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it’s important to remember that the house always has the edge. This is never more true than when playing games of chance like craps, where the odds of winning are incredibly low.

In fact, the odds of winning at craps are just 1 in 36 - meaning you have a better chance of being struck by lightning than walking away with a winning bet. This is because the house has a built-in advantage known as the ‘house edge’.

This edge is what allows casinos to make money in the long run, no matter how many players they have. So if you’re ever tempted to roll the dice and chase that big win, remember that you’re likely to lose in the end.
