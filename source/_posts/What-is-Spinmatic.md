#  What is Spinmatic?

#

Spinmatic is a new company that has developed a unique way to produce electricity. Their technology, known as the Spinning Core Generator, is a large, metal sphere that spins at high speeds to create energy. The company has plans to build large-scale generators that will supply power to entire cities.

#

The origins of Spinmatic date back to 2006, when inventor Paul Dabrowski came up with the idea for the Spinning Core Generator. After spending several years developing the technology, Dabrowski founded Spinmatic in 2013 to bring the generator to market.

#

The Spinning Core Generator works by using the principles of centrifugal force and inertia. As the metal sphere spins, it creates an electrical current that can be used to power homes and businesses. The generator is said to be more efficient than traditional methods of generating electricity, such as coal-fired plants or nuclear reactors.

Spinmatic is currently in the process of building its first large-scale generator in Cleveland, Ohio. The generator will have a capacity of 10 megawatts and will provide power to homes and businesses in the area. Plans are also in place to build similar generators in other cities around the United States.
