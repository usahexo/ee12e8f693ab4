#  Sports Betting Taxes Could Bankrupt Your Favorite Team

A recent study released by the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24013) suggests that sports betting could have a significant impact on state and local government tax revenues. The study, which was funded in part by the [American Gaming Association](https://www.americangaming.org/), found that while the legalization of sports betting could result in an increase in tax revenue for some states, it could also lead to a decrease in tax revenue for others. In states where gambling is currently illegal, the report estimates that legalizing sports betting could generate anywhere from $6 billion to $18 billion in annual tax revenue.

The findings of the study are likely to be welcomed by the gaming industry, which has long been lobbying for the legalization of sports betting. The American Gaming Association, which represents casinos and gaming companies nationwide, has been pushing for Congress to pass a bill that would legalize sports betting nationwide. The Association argues that the legalization of sports betting would create thousands of new jobs and generate billions of dollars in new tax revenue.

But not everyone is on board with the idea of legalizing sports betting. Some opponents argue that the legalization of sports betting could lead to an increase in problem gambling rates and drain money away from state lottery programs. They also argue that there is no guarantee that states will see an increase in tax revenue from legalized sports betting, as most bets will likely take place online or offshore where there is no taxation.

So far, only a handful of states have legalized sports betting,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) including Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia. More states are expected to follow suit in the coming years, as the gaming industry continues to push for congressional action.

#  Millions of Dollars in Sports Betting Taxes Owed Each Year

As the sports world gears up for another season, fans across the country are preparing to make their bets. But even as they place their money on the line, few of them likely realize how much tax revenue is generated from sports betting each year.

According to the American Gaming Association, Americans bet $150 billion on sports in 2017. Out of that total, an estimated $24 billion was wagered illegally. If all that money was wagered through legal channels, it would generate more than $3.5 billion in taxes.

That number is only going to grow in the coming years, as more and more states legalize sports betting. In fact, New Jersey is expected to bring in nearly $100 million in taxes from sports betting this year alone.

So why hasn’t Congress acted to legalize sports betting nationwide?

One reason may be that lawmakers are hesitant to upset the major professional sports leagues. The NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB have all been lobbying against legalized sports betting, arguing that it could lead to game-fixing and other forms of corruption.

While those concerns are certainly valid, they don’t seem to be stopping people from wagering illegally. And with billions of dollars at stake, it’s clear that there’s a lot of money to be made from legalized sports betting.

So far, Congress has been unwilling to act on this issue. But with more and more states legalizing sports betting, that may soon change.

#  New Jersey Collects More than $1.5 Million in Sports Betting Taxes in First Two Months

On July 1, 2018, New Jersey began collecting sports betting taxes from casinos and racetracks. In the first two months, the state has collected more than $1.5 million in sports betting taxes.

According to state officials, the tax revenue is already being used to fund programs that benefit residents of New Jersey. Some of the programs that have been funded include education, crime prevention, and drug addiction treatment.

In addition to the tax revenue, New Jersey has also seen a surge in tourism since sports betting became legal. This is likely due to the fact that out-of-state visitors can now place bets on sporting events without having to travel to another state.

New Jersey is not the only state that has seen a rise in tax revenue from sports betting. Delaware also started collecting taxes on July 1, and in the first month they collected $442,000. Pennsylvania is expected to start collecting taxes in September, and analysts are predicting that they will bring in around $100 million per year in tax revenue.

So far, it appears that legalizing sports betting has been a successful decision for states across the country. Not only does it provide a new stream of tax revenue, but it also creates jobs and boosts tourism. It will be interesting to see how other states decide to handle sports betting in the future.

#  Pennsylvania Sees $3.5M in Revenue from Sports Betting Taxes in First Month

Pennsylvania has collected more than $3.5 million in taxes from sports betting in the first month since it became legal, state officials said on Thursday.

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board said $3,546,332 was generated from June 14 to July 13 from the 10 casinos that offer sports betting. The board said nearly 545,000 bets were placed in that time.

State taxes on gambling are split between casino operators and the state government. Casino operators must pay a 34 percent tax on their gambling revenue, including sports betting, and the state government receives a 36 percent cut.

That gives Pennsylvania a take of $1,219,711 on the $3.546 million in taxes collected.

#  Nevada Gambling Industry Braces for Impact of Sports Betting Taxes

Nevada’s gambling industry is preparing for the potential impact of new taxes on sports betting.

The state legislature is considering a bill that would impose a 10 percent tax on all sports bets, which could generate up to $60 million in revenue annually. The bill has yet to be voted on, but gambling industry officials say they are bracing for its passage.

“It would be devastating,” said Bill Cassell, a spokesman for the Nevada Gaming Control Board. “It would cut into our gaming revenue and have a direct impact on jobs and tax revenue in the state.”

Cassell said the tax would likely lead to fewer people placing bets and could also mean that casinos are forced to reduce their betting limits. That, in turn, could lead to a decline in tourism and leave the state with less money to fund important services like education and healthcare.

Industry officials are also concerned about how the new tax would affect online betting, which has become increasingly popular in recent years. They warn that it could lead to an exodus of business from Nevada to other states such as New Jersey and Delaware, which have already legalized sports betting.

Governor Brian Sandoval is opposed to the bill and has urged the legislature not to pass it. He has said that it would have a negative impact on the state’s economy and cost jobs.
